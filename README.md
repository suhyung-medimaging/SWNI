# SWNI (Sliding-window Needle Identification)

The needle identification refers to the problem of visualizing the needle trajectory and tip position during the passage of the biopsy needle, 
which is highly challenging to detect due to undesirable artifacts and hyperechoic anatomical structures that might interfere with the needle during clinical procedures.

This work contributes to: 
1) to formulate dynamic needle tracking as a sparse recovery problem with a background subspace.
2) to utilize data redundancy across time frames unlike the conventional methods that use only a few number of frames for needle detection.
3) to introduce a sliding-window scheme by equidistantly dividing a temporal range to reduce the computational burden.
